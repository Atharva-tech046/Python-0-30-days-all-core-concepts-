# Variables = It is name given to a memory location in a program .... examples are given below 

name =  'Atharva' #so here the variable is name and the data stored in the variable is 'Atharva'
age = 20 
weight = '78 kilos'

# Now lets print variables 
# So first we write the print statement and thn the name of the variable 
# no need to write the variable name in quotes as we have already defines the variable above !

print('My name is :',name)
print('My age is :',age)
print('My weight is:',weight)

# now making a new variable age2 ..... saying age2=age 

age2=age

#now if we say print age2 it will print the same value decared in variable age since age2=age 

print(age2)
